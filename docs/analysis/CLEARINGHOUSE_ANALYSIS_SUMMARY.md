# Clearinghouse Analysis Summary – Canonical Real-Time Replay

**Analysis Date**: November 13, 2025  
**Event Window**: October 10, 2025, 21:15-21:27 UTC  
**Data Sources**: Hyperliquid clearinghouse snapshot (block 758750000) + full event replay (`scripts/reconstruction/full_analysis_realtime.py`)  
**Status**: ✅ Canonical real-time dataset verified (34,983 ADL events, 100% coverage)

> This document supersedes the Phase-2 snapshot report (31,444-event approximation). Snapshot-era outputs are preserved in git history for reference; all current figures and files derive from the canonical real-time reconstruction (`adl_detailed_analysis_REALTIME.csv`).

## 🎯 Executive Summary

We replayed 3,239,706 clearinghouse events (fills, funding, ledger updates) from the 20:04:54 UTC snapshot through the end of the 12-minute cascade (21:27:00 UTC). The canonical dataset captures every ADL with real-time account value, leverage, and equity. Key outcomes:

- **ADL targets profit, not leverage** – 94.5% of ADL'd positions were profitable (avg +80.6% PNL).
- **Low leverage is no shield** – Median real-time leverage was 0.18x; 84.9% of positions carried <1x leverage.
- **Negative-equity accounts quantified** – 302 accounts fell below zero equity (−$23.19M absorbed by insurance/HLP reserves).
- **Per-asset coverage stable** – ADL delivered ~35% of liquidation notional on every major ticker (mean 35.4%, median 33.2%).

Every major ADL remained profitable at execution; leverage spans modest values because account equity is calculated in real time.

## 🛡️ Negative Equity & Insurance Fund Impact

- Accounts in negative equity at ADL time: **302**  
- Aggregate deficit (cash + unrealized PNL): **−$23,191,104**  
- These losses explain the insurance/HLP drawdown quantified in `docs/findings/INSURANCE_FUND_IMPACT.md`.

## 🔬 Methodology (Phase 3 – Real-Time Reconstruction)

1. **Snapshot Load** – Parse account and position snapshots at block 758750000 (20:04:54 UTC).  
2. **Event Replay** – Process 3.24M events chronologically with `scripts/reconstruction/full_analysis_realtime.py`, updating account balances, positions, and PNL after every fill/funding/ledger change.  
3. **ADL Extraction** – Record all 34,983 ADL fills with contemporaneous account state, leverage, and equity.  
4. **Verification** – Cross-check totals with raw ADL feed (`adl_fills_full_12min_raw.csv`), liquidation feed (`liquidations_full_12min.csv`), and downstream analyses (`scripts/verification/verify_all_findings.py`).

All statistics in this summary come directly from the canonical CSV generated by the replay (`adl_detailed_analysis_REALTIME.csv`).

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- **ADL prioritizes profitable counterparties** – Winners are tapped to cover liquidation losses regardless of leverage level.
- **Low leverage does not eliminate ADL risk** – The bulk of ADLs carried <1x leverage at execution.
- **Insurance/HLP buffers absorbed $23.19M** – Now quantified via negative-equity detection in the canonical dataset.
- **Per-asset matching remains strict** – See `docs/findings/PER_ASSET_ISOLATION.md` for empirical evidence of zero cross-asset contagion.

## 📘 For Researchers

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load canonical realtime dataset
adl = pd.read_csv('adl_detailed_analysis_REALTIME.csv')
assert len(adl) == 34_983
assert {'leverage_realtime','account_value_realtime','is_negative_equity'} <= set(adl.columns)
print('✅ Canonical realtime dataset loaded')
```

**Analysis Completed**: November 13, 2025  
**Data Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (cli replay, real-time metrics)  
**Coverage**: 100% of the 12-minute cascade  
**Approximations**: 0 – all metrics derived from chain replay

**Bottom line:** the canonical clearinghouse replay confirms that ADL forcibly closes the most profitable positions to absorb liquidation losses, with precise leverage and equity measurements captured in real time.
