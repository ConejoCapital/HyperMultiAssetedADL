- **Real-time account values (cash-only)** at exact ADL moment (snapshot unrealized PnL removed)
- **Real-time leverage** calculated with reconstructed account states:
  - **Median: 0.20x** ← Most ADL'd accounts use very low leverage
  - **95th percentile: 5.10x** ← Even high-leverage accounts are well below Hyperliquid's 40x max
  - **99th percentile: 122.69x** ← Outliers are data artifacts from liquidation delays (see `docs/findings/HIGH_LEVERAGE_OUTLIERS_EXPLANATION.md`)
- **Negative equity detection** (302 accounts, **−$23.19M** aggregate deficit)
- **Zero shortcuts** - 3.2M events processed chronologically

## BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY: ADL Targets PROFIT, Not Leverage!

** See: [ADL_PRIORITIZATION_VERIFIED.md](docs/findings/ADL_PRIORITIZATION_VERIFIED.md)**

**MYTH:** "ADL targets the highest leverage positions" 
**REALITY:** **DEBUNKED - ADL targets the MOST PROFITABLE positions**

### The Evidence (34,983 Real-Time ADL Events Analyzed - 100% Coverage)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Profitable positions ADL'd** | **99.4%** (34,775 / 34,983) |
| **Average unrealized PNL** | **+80.58%** |
| **Median unrealized PNL** | **+50.09%** |
| **Median leverage (REAL-TIME)** | **0.20x** (VERY LOW!) |
| **95th percentile leverage** | **3.22x** (LOW!) |
| **99th percentile leverage** | **74.18x** |
| **Negative equity accounts** | **302 (0.86%)** |
| **Insurance fund impact** | **-$23,191,104** |

**Note on leverage**: Most ADL'd positions had extremely low leverage. The **median of 0.20x** is the key metric—showing that most ADL'd accounts used very conservative leverage. The 95th percentile at **5.10x** is still well below Hyperliquid's 40x maximum. The 99th percentile at **122.69x** represents data artifacts from liquidation delays (accounts with near-zero value when ADL closed them), not actual high-leverage trading. See `docs/findings/HIGH_LEVERAGE_OUTLIERS_EXPLANATION.md` for details. This debunks the myth that ADL targets high leverage.

### Top 10 ADL'd Positions (By Size)

| Coin | Notional | PNL% | Leverage | Account Value |
|------|----------|------|----------|---------------|
| BTC | $193.4M | **+12.73%** | 0.66x | $159.5M |
| **ETH** | **$174.2M** | **+21.84%** | 1.79x | $82.7M |
| BTC | $76.4M | **+12.60%** | 0.66x | $159.5M |
| BTC | $70.6M | **+13.82%** | 2.92x | $29.1M |
| SOL | $46.7M | **+16.07%** | 2.01x | $23.2M |
| ETH | $41.3M | **+26.37%** | 1.73x | $82.7M |
| ETH | $41.2M | **+26.47%** | 1.42x | $29.1M |
| ETH | $38.3M | **+33.08%** | 2.11x | $18.1M |
| BTC | $30.3M | **+10.37%** | 4.80x | $6.3M |
| SOL | $29.5M | **+35.77%** | 0.54x | $54.4M |

**Every single one was PROFITABLE.** This is not a coincidence.

### What This Means

 **LOW LEVERAGE ≠ SAFE FROM ADL** 
 **HIGH PROFIT = ADL TARGET**

**If you're sitting on a huge unrealized gain during a liquidation cascade, you're getting ADL'd—regardless of leverage.**

**Key Insight**: ADL is a **forced exit mechanism for winners**, not punishment for reckless traders. The protocol uses your profits to cover liquidated losses.

## INSURANCE FUND IMPACT: Quantifying the Underwater Accounts

** Real-Time Reconstruction Reveals**: 302 accounts in negative equity

### The Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Accounts underwater** | **302** (0.86% of ADL'd) |
| **Total negative equity** | **-$23,191,104** |
| **Insurance fund coverage required** | $23,191,104 |
| **Average underwater account** | -$95,322 |

### What This Means

When an account's **total equity (cash + unrealized PNL) goes negative**, losses must be socialized:

1. **ADL activates** to close out profitable positions
2. **Underwater losses** get absorbed by the insurance fund
3. **If insurance fund insufficient** -> socializes losses to remaining traders

**This cascade required $23,191,104 in insurance fund coverage** to prevent loss socialization.

### Real-Time Reconstruction Achievement

This is the **first time negative equity has been quantified** for a Hyperliquid cascade:
- Processed **3.2M events** chronologically (COMPLETE 12-minute window)
- Reconstructed **437,723 account states** in real-time
- Calculated equity at every ADL moment
- Identified exact underwater amount
- **100% event coverage** (34,983 / 34,983 ADL events)

**Methodology**: [scripts/reconstruction/full_analysis_realtime.py](scripts/reconstruction/full_analysis_realtime.py)

## CRITICAL FINDING: Per-Asset Isolation - Zero ADL Contagion

** See: [PER_ASSET_ISOLATION.md](docs/findings/PER_ASSET_ISOLATION.md)**

**MYTH:** "BTC liquidations can trigger ETH ADL" or "ADL contagion across assets" 
**REALITY:** **DISPROVEN - Zero cases of cross-asset ADL found**

### Key Evidence

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Timestamps analyzed** | 100 (liquidations + ADL in same timestamp) |
| **Cross-asset ADL cases** | **0 (ZERO)** |
| **Ticker overlap** | 96.74% |
| **Perfect 1:1 ratio matches** | 44/44 tickers at biggest burst |

### What This Proves

 **BTC liquidations cause ONLY BTC ADL** (never ETH, SOL, or other assets) 
 **ETH liquidations cause ONLY ETH ADL** (never BTC, SOL, or other assets) 
 **SOL liquidations cause ONLY SOL ADL** (never BTC, ETH, or other assets) 
 **Each asset has independent ADL engine** (no shared risk pool) 
 **Perfect 1:1 matching per asset** when ADL triggers 

### Important Distinction

 **ADL contagion** (technical): Does NOT exist 
 **Market contagion** (price dynamics): DOES exist

**Example:**
```
BTC crashes -> Market panic -> Traders sell all assets
 v v v
BTC price v Psychology ETH price v, SOL price v
 v v v
BTC liquidations ETH liquidations SOL liquidations
 v v v
BTC ADL ONLY ETH ADL ONLY SOL ADL ONLY

Market contagion: YES (prices correlate)
ADL contagion: NO (ADL systems isolated)
```

**Analysis of 100 timestamps proves:**
- 0/100 cases where Asset X liquidations caused Asset Y ADL
- When 44 assets had liquidations simultaneously, each got its own ADL (no spillover)
- Perfect architectural isolation despite $7.6B cascade

**Full analysis**: [PER_ASSET_ISOLATION.md](docs/findings/PER_ASSET_ISOLATION.md)

## TOTAL MARKET IMPACT (Liquidations + ADL)

**NEW: Complete cascade analysis now available!**

| Metric | Liquidations | ADL | **TOTAL IMPACT** |
|--------|--------------|-----|------------------|
| **Events** | 63,637 | 34,983 | **98,620** |
| **Net Notional** | $5.51B | $2.10B | **$7.61 BILLION** |
| **Realized PNL** | -$607.7M | $834.3M | **$226.6M net** |

** This represents the largest documented liquidation cascade event:**
- **$7.6 BILLION** in forced closures in 12 minutes
- **98,620 forced events** (liquidations + ADL)
- **$5.5B liquidated** -> **$2.1B ADL'd** to cover losses

 **See full analysis**: Run `scripts/analysis/total_impact_analysis.py` to generate the report (or see `data/canonical/cash-only balances ADL event orderbook 2025-10-10/ADL_NET_VOLUME_FULL_12MIN.md` for ADL-specific analysis)

---

## NEW: ADL Mechanism Research - How It Really Works

### 1. Individual Event Analysis

** See: [ADL_MECHANISM_RESEARCH.md](docs/findings/ADL_MECHANISM_RESEARCH.md)**

We analyzed the **largest single ADL event** ($174.18M ETH) to understand **how ADL is triggered** using empirical blockchain data:

### 2. CASCADE TIMING DISCOVERY 

** See: [CASCADE_TIMING_ANALYSIS.md](docs/analysis/CASCADE_TIMING_ANALYSIS.md)**

**MAJOR FINDING:** Liquidations happen in waves BEFORE ADL kicks in!

### 3. BATCH PROCESSING DISCOVERY 

** See: [BATCH_PROCESSING_DISCOVERY.md](docs/analysis/BATCH_PROCESSING_DISCOVERY.md)**

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Liquidations and ADL execute in SEPARATE, SEQUENTIAL BATCHES!

Even when they share the same millisecond timestamp, liquidations and ADL are **processed sequentially, not concurrently**:

| Finding | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| **Same timestamp** | Both recorded at `21:16:04.831874` |
| **Different batches** | 11,279 liquidations -> THEN 11,279 ADLs |
| **Zero interleaving** | 0% mixing across 100 analyzed timestamps |
| **Universal pattern** | 100% of events show liquidation -> ADL order |

**The Architecture:**
```
Block at timestamp T:
 Phase 1: Process ALL liquidations (liquidation engine)
 Phase 2: Calculate total losses & ADL requirements
 Phase 3: Select profitable positions for ADL
 Phase 4: Process ALL ADLs (ADL engine)

All events stamped with timestamp T, but SEQUENCED internally!
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Reveals internal processing order (liquidation engine -> ADL engine)
- Proves sequential dependency (ADL calculated AFTER liquidations)
- Explains visual patterns (chunks on visualization are REAL batches)
- No concurrent liquidation+ADL (clear execution phases)

**Technical Detail:** At the largest burst, 22,558 events occurred at the exact same millisecond, but analysis of event ordering shows perfect batch separation: events 710-11,988 were all liquidations, events 11,989-23,267 were all ADLs. Average batch run length: 11,279 events (no interleaving detected).

---

| Metric | Value | Insight |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **First liquidation** | 0.0 seconds | Cascade starts (T+3s absolute) |
| **First ADL** | 61.7 seconds later | ≈62-second delay before ADL kicks in |
| **Liquidations before ADL** | **710 events** | System tries normal methods first |
| **Correlation** | 0.945 | Liquidations predict ADL |
| **Biggest burst** | 22,558 events/second | 11,279 liqs + 11,279 ADLs |

**The Pattern:**
```
0-61s: 710 liquidations, 0 ADL ← ADL hasn't kicked in yet
62s:   11,279 liquidations + 11,279 ADL ← MASSIVE burst when threshold hit
63-180s: Alternating waves ← Liquidations → ADL → Liquidations → ADL
```

**Why This Matters:**
- ADL is NOT instantaneous – there's a ~62-second delay
- ADL activates in BURSTS (threshold-based, not continuous)
- Liquidations accumulate → Threshold reached → ADL fires
- Explains the "chunks" pattern visible on [HyperFireworks visualization](https://hyperfireworks.vercel.app/)

---

### Key Discovery: ADL is a Direct Counterparty to Liquidations

**The $174M ETH ADL had 265 corresponding liquidations at the EXACT same timestamp:**

| Event Type | Amount | User | What Happened |
|------------|--------|------|---------------|
| **Liquidations** | $204.67M | `0xb0a5...540` | 265 ETH longs liquidated (losing money) |
| **ADL** | $174.18M | `0x2ea1...3f4` | 1 ETH short ADL'd (winning forced to close) |

**Timeline:**
1. ETH price crashed -> User's 265 long positions hit liquidation price
2. $204.67M in liquidations triggered -> Exchange needs sellers
3. Profitable short holder ADL'd for $174.18M -> Provides liquidity
4. Insurance/HLP fund covers remaining $30M gap

### What This Means

 **ADL is NOT random** - It's triggered by liquidation events 
 **ADL provides counterparty liquidity** - When liquidations happen, ADL supplies the opposite side 
 **Same-millisecond execution** - Liquidation -> ADL happens instantly 
 **Profitable traders pay the price** - Winners get force-closed to save losers from socialized losses

### Why This Matters for Research

This is the **first empirical documentation** of ADL-liquidation coupling:
- Proves ADL is triggered BY liquidations (not independent)
- Shows exact timing relationship (same millisecond)
- Quantifies the counterparty relationship ($174M ADL <-> $205M liquidations)
- Explains why insurance funds don't cover 100% (ADL does most of the work)

## Comparison: 2-Minute Sample vs Full Event

| Metric | 2-Minute Sample | Full 12-Minute | Scaling Factor |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Time Window** | 21:15-21:17 UTC | 21:15-21:27 UTC | 6.0x |
| **Total Notional** | $285.5M | $2,103.1M | **7.37x** |
| **Total Events** | 14,194 | 34,983 | 2.46x |
| **Assets** | 65 tickers | 162 tickers | 2.49x |

**Why 7.37x instead of 6x?**
- ADL events were **not evenly distributed** over time
- **Peak activity** around 21:19-21:20 UTC (after the 2-min sample)
- The 2-minute sample (21:15-21:17) was relatively early in the event

## What is ADL Net Volume?

**Auto-Deleveraging (ADL)** is Hyperliquid's mechanism to manage liquidations during extreme market volatility:

1. When positions are liquidated but can't be closed by the liquidation engine
2. The protocol **force-closes** the most profitable opposing positions
3. This is called "Auto-Deleveraging" (ADL)

**Net Volume** = Sum of all position sizes that were ADL'd per ticker 
**Net Notional** = Sum of (position size × price) for all ADL'd positions

---

## Methodology

### Data Source
- **File**: `node_fills_20251010_21.lz4` (S3 bucket)
- **Total fills analyzed**: 1,424,266 fills
- **ADL fills**: 34,983 (2.5% of all fills)
- **Filtered**: Excluded @ tokens (spot positions)

### Calculations
```python
# Net Volume per ticker
net_volume = sum(size) for all ADL events per ticker

# Net Notional per ticker 
net_notional = sum(size × price) for all ADL events per ticker

# Total Realized PNL per ticker
total_pnl = sum(closed_pnl) for all ADL events per ticker
```

### Filters Applied
1. **Direction = "Auto-Deleveraging"** (blockchain label)
2. **Exclude tickers starting with "@"** (spot positions)
3. **Time window**: 21:15:00 - 21:27:00 UTC (full 12 minutes)

---

## Data Quality

**100% Blockchain-Verified**:
- Complete 12-minute dataset (not a sample)
- Blockchain-verified: Only fills with explicit "Auto-Deleveraging" label
- No heuristics: Direct from S3 node_fills
- Spot positions excluded: @ tokens filtered out
- Cross-validated: Matches expected event timeline

**Source**: Hyperliquid S3 `node_fills_20251010_21.lz4` 
**Processing time**: ~30 seconds 
**Records**: 42,893 blocks -> 1.42M fills -> 34,983 ADL events

### Real-Time Reconstruction Achievement

**We processed 3.2M events to reconstruct exact account states (FULL 12-minute cascade):**

**Data processed**:
- Snapshot at block 758750000 (20:04:54 UTC) - 437,723 accounts
- All fills with `closedPnl` (3.2M fills processed)
- All funding events (from misc events)
- All deposits/withdrawals (from ledger updates)
- Real-time price tracking (last traded price per asset)

**Reconstruction process**:
1. Started with snapshot account values
2. Looped through all **3,239,706 events** chronologically (FULL 12 minutes)
3. Updated account value: `account_value += closedPnl` for each fill
4. Processed funding events from misc events
5. Processed deposit/withdrawal events
6. Calculated unrealized PNL using real-time prices
7. Got account value at **exact ADL moment**

**Results**:
- Real-time account values at every ADL moment
- Accurate negative equity detection (302 accounts identified)
- Precise leverage ratios (median 0.20x)
- Insurance fund impact quantified ($23,191,104)
- **100% event coverage** (34,983 ADL events)
