## Key Insights

### Market Impact
- **Top 3 tickers** account for 65.7% of total ADL volume
- **BTC** was the largest ADL'd asset by notional value
- **Most ADL'd ticker**: HYPE ($136,989,589)

### Profitability
- **Total realized PNL** from ADL'd positions: $142,118,725
- **Average PNL per ticker**: $2,220,605
- **Most profitable ADL**: HYPE ($38,811,267)

---

## Methodology

### Data Source
- **Source**: SonarX Hyperliquid data (blockchain-verified)
- **Filter**: Only fills with `DIR = "Auto-Deleveraging"`
- **Exclusions**: @ tokens (spot positions that cannot be ADL'd)

### Calculations
- **Net Volume**: Sum of all ADL'd position sizes per ticker
- **Net Notional**: Sum of (size × price) for all ADL events
- **Total PNL**: Sum of realized PNL from ADL closures

### Time Coverage
This analysis covers a **2-minute sample** (21:15-21:17 UTC) from the full ADL event window (21:15-21:27 UTC). The full event would show approximately **6x these volumes**.

---

## Limitations

⚠️ **Important**: This is a 2-minute sample, not the full 12-minute event

- **Time window**: Only 21:15-21:17 UTC (2 minutes)
- **Full event**: 21:15-21:27 UTC (12 minutes)
- **Scaling factor**: ~6x for full event estimate

For the complete ADL volume, multiply these values by approximately 6.

---

## Data Quality

✅ **Blockchain-verified**: All ADL events extracted from `DIR` field  
✅ **No heuristics**: Only explicitly labeled ADL events  
✅ **Spot positions excluded**: @ tokens filtered out  
✅ **Validated**: Cross-checked with S3 extraction
